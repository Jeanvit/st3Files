# About
This is my Sublime Text 3's configuration files and dictionaries, optimized for personal use. It's constantly changing because I'm building it from scratch.

# Installation
- [Install Sublime 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or backup your current config files: `cp ~/.config/sublime-text-3 ~/.config/sublime-text-3-oldconf`
- Install Package Control by clicking  `« Install Package Control »`
- Clone the project in your config folder `git clone https://github.com/jeanvit/st3Files.git ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`
- Start Sublime and wait the installation.
